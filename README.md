All my vim dotfiles

## History
I have been using vim and gvim since March of 2000. For years and years I never really bothered to use any plugins. Just using vim straight from the box. In 2003, my wife and I totally switched over to using dvorak keyboard layout. For the last couple of years I have started using several plugins. My first real major plugin usage was with spf13 vim plugin setup. I started noticing that vim has really started to lag and sometimes would crash. Was I loading way too many plugins. I felt resolved to create my old vimrc file and to only use plugins that I fully have learned and use. No wasted memory space. This is my result. 

I will continually keep updating my vimrc setup.
